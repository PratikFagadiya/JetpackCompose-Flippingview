# Flipping View

Why settle for boring, static screens in your app when you can add a dynamic and engaging visual experience with FlippingView?

**It's time to give your app the wow-factor it deserves!**

**FlippingView** library is built with the latest Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3 API technology, making it both cutting-edge and experimental. It's super easy to use, and our code is well-documented, so you'll be flipping cards like a pro in no time.

## How to use
You can create a FlippingView with the `FlippingViewl` composable.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun FlippingView(
    cardFace: CardFace,
    cardOrientation: CardOrientation = CardOrientation.HORIZONTAL,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    flippingDuration: Int = 2000,
    cardShadow: Int = 0,
    cornerSize: Dp = 0.dp,
    onViewClick: (CardFace) -> Unit,
    frontView: @Composable () -> Unit = {},
    backView: @Composable () -> Unit = {}
)
```
In it's simplest form **FlippingView** can be used as animated preview for front and back view.

```kotlin

var cardFace by remember { mutableStateOf(CardFace.Front) }

FlippingView(cardFace = cardFace, onViewClick = {
      cardFace = it.whatNext
  }, frontView = {
      // Front View
  }, backView = {
      // Back View
  }
)

```

### Customization
```kotlin
var cardFace by remember {
    mutableStateOf(CardFace.Front)  // Initial Value Either  CardFace.Front or CardFace.Back
}

FlippingView(cardFace = cardFace,

    // Card flipping orientation default value is `HORIZONTAL` you can use `HORIZONTAL` or `VERTICAL`
    cardOrientation = CardOrientation.HORIZONTAL,

    // Customize modifier as per your requirement
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .aspectRatio(1.655F),

    // Flipping duration in millisecond default value is 2s (2000)
    flippingDuration = 700,

    // Flip view on card click, You can perform your requirement as well
    onViewClick = {
        cardFace = it.whatNext
    },

    // Default card shadow value is 0, You can customize as per your need
    cardShadow = 5,

    // Card rounded corner radius for your card layout, default value is 0.dp
    cornerSize = 15.dp,

    // Card front view
    frontView = {

    },

    // Card back view
    backView = {

    }
)
```
